# JMusic - Java Runtime Required (Launch4J Version)

This version of JMusic requires Java 21 to run, but it was not found on your system.

## Why this happened:
You are running the Launch4J wrapper version of JMusic, which needs a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) or Java Development Kit (JDK) to execute. The launcher could not find a compatible Java installation.

> **Note:** Native platform-specific versions of JMusic (Windows .exe, macOS .app, Linux binaries) will not require Java pre-installation.

## How to fix this:

1. **Download Microsoft JDK 21** from the official link:
   - https://aka.ms/download-jdk/microsoft-jdk-21.0.9-windows-x64.exe

2. **Run the installer** and follow the installation steps

3. **Restart JMusic** after installation is complete

The Microsoft JDK 21 is the recommended Java distribution for Windows and provides the best compatibility with JMusic.

## If you already have Java installed:
You may need to add it to your system PATH or set JAVA_HOME environment variable.
