                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use this
General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any
other work released this way by its authors. You can use it for your
programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change software or use pieces of it in new free
programs, and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of software, or if you
modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that
you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and
developers' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.

  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting
users' freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such
abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is
precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed
this version of the GPL to forbid the practice for those products. If
such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to
extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as
needed to protect the freedom of users.

  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on universal computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid
the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it
effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents
cannot be used to render the program non-free.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.

  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License. Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy. The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.

  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for copyright
infringement, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private
copy. Propagation includes copying, redistribution, reverse engineering,
displaying, performing, and public transmission.

  A "contribute" means to make available to the public a covered work, in
any form, that you cannot ensure will remain within the bounds of this
License. To make available a covered work means for its propagation to be
legally permitted outside of the GNU GPL.

  A "contribution" means any material that you make available to the
public, regardless of its form, that you cannot ensure will remain within
the bounds of this License.

  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it. "Object code" means any non-source form of a
work.

  A "user product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
tangible personal property normally used for personal, family, or
household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
of the particular user. Software embedded in a user product is a covered
work.

  The "Installation Information" for a user product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that user product
from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
code is in no way prevented or interfered with because changes have been
made.

  "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
the source code for that work, including any associated interface
definition files and scripts used to control compilation and installation
of the object code, or to modify the product as a whole. For example, it
would include script files that are commonly used to control compilation
and installation in a typical open source workflow. If the program is a
standalone library, without which other work cannot run, its
Corresponding Source refers to the object code itself.

  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
Source.

  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same
work.

  1. Source Code License.

  This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License. "The Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "covered work" means either
the Program or a work based on the Program.

  Your rights under this License will terminate automatically if you
violate any term of this License.

  Subject to the foregoing, and as long as your license and the license
of its authors are not terminated, you are granted a non-exclusive,
worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to propagate this covered work,
such license including the right to make, publically display, sell,
import, and distribute copies of the work.

  This License does not allow you to make or distribute copies of any
work with technical protection measures that would prevent users or
third parties from exercising the GNU GPL's freedoms.

  You may not make available any work that contains modifications or
additions that would prevent users or third parties from enforcing
the GNU GPL's freedoms from the work, even if those modifications or
additions are made with your permission.

  2. Basic Permissions.

  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program. The copyright holder grants
permission to make, publically display, sell, import, and distribute
copies of the Program's source code, as well as make, publically
display, sell, import, and distribute copies of any modified version.

  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under Article 11
of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar
laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.

  When you propagate a covered work, you waive any legal rights to
prohibit circumvention of technological measures that affect the Program,
if they are implemented in reliance on GNU GPL version 3, and you agree
to allow any work that contains such measures to be released under the
GNU GPL or later versions.

  4. Patents.

  A patent license is granted to the extent that it would be necessary to
allow you to use and distribute copies of the covered work on any work,
under the terms of this License, solely for making, using, selling,
importing, and distributing copies of those works. This patent license
is non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, and irrevocable.

  The patent license is effective as of your first use or possession
of a covered work.

  You may not make available any work that contains modifications or
additions, if your license and the licenses of its authors to that work
are terminated by an infringement of a patent, and if the patent
was used to make an effective technological measure that was not already
covered by the GNU GPL version 3.

  5. Propagating a Covered Work.

  You may propagate covered works only if you satisfy all of the
conditions of this License. The conditions are met if and only if
you make available a copy of the covered work, with its Corresponding
Source, in a form that is available to the public. If a covered work
contains modifications or additions that were not covered by the GNU GPL,
you must make them available under the GNU GPL as well.

  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

  You may propagate a covered work in object code form under the terms
of sections 4 and 5, provided that it also accompanies the
Corresponding Source, which must be conveyed in a form that is available
to the public.

  7. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

  You can use the source code of a covered work under the terms of this
License. You may modify your copy or copies of any covered work to form
a work based on that work, and provide copies of your modifications or
additions in source form. Any modifications or additions you make must
be licensed under the GNU GPL. You must clearly identify the changes,
and you must ensure that all code that you make publicly available
under the GNU GPL is available to the public, even if you are not the
author of those changes.

  8. No Sublicensing.

  You may not sublicense any rights under this License.

  9. Termination.

  Your rights under this License are subject to termination if you violate
any term of this License. If your rights to a covered work are terminated
by a violation, a new grant of rights may be subject to a different
license.

  10. Amendments.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public
License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or
of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the
Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public
License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free
Software Foundation.

  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
public statement of acceptance of a version will permanently authorize
you to choose that version for the Program.

  11. Disclaimer of Warranty.

  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. Limitation of Liability.

  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR
THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software that everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is located.

      <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
      Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

      This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
      it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
      the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
      (at your option) any later version.

      This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
      but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
      MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
      GNU General Public License for more details.

      You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
      along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program does a terminal-interactive output, when it starts to run
a short notice like this should be printed:

  <program data>
  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
  This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
  This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
  under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.
For more information on this, and how to apply the GNU GPL and GNU LGPL
to new programs, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
into proprietary programs. If your program is a library, you may consider
it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library.
If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License
instead of this License. But first, please read <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0-standalone.html>.
